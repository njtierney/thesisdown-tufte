# Thesis in bookdown with tufte

This is my minimal example of using [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) to write a thesis with [tufte](https://github.com/rstudio/tufte).

Ideally this will help address issues like:

- How do I define subsubsections
- How do I specify the correct starting number for chapters

And more!
