# Thesis in bookdown with tufte

This is my minimal example of using [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) to write a thesis with [tufte](https://github.com/rstudio/tufte).

Ideally this will help address questions like:

- How do I define subsubsections correctly?
- How do I get the numbering of sections to correctly line up?
- How do I include a list of tables/figures?

And more!
